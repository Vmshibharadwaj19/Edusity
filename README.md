## File Details

### App.jsx

This file contains the main component that represents the structure of the application. React hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, etc., are used for managing component state and side effects. The components are organized in a modular fashion to ensure reusability and scalability.

### main.jsx

The `main.jsx` file serves as the entry point of the application, rendering the `App` component into the root element of the HTML structure using `ReactDOM.createRoot()`.

### index.css

The global CSS file customizes the basic look and feel of the app, using the "Outfit" font family. The CSS includes a mobile-first design approach using media queries to ensure responsiveness across various screen sizes.

#### CSS Highlights:

- **Reset Styles:** Applied to all elements to remove margin, padding, and box-sizing.
- **Container Styles:** For page layout with flexible padding.
- **Button Styling:** Custom button classes such as `.btn` and `.dark-btn` for different themes.
- **Responsive Design:** Media queries for adapting the layout on smaller screen sizes.
